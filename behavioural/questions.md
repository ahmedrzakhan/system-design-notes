## Follow-Up Questions to Expect

For any story you tell, be ready for:

- "How did others react?"
- "What was the outcome for the relationship?"
- "What did you learn?"
- "Can you give me another example?"
- "Walk me through your thought process"
- "What was the biggest challenge?"

## Preparation Strategy

**Use the 10-step roadmap from the blogs:**

1. Create your project inventory/brag document
2. Pick 5-7 core stories that can cover multiple signal areas
3. CARL-structure each story
4. Practice the "Menu Technique" for stories with different takeaways
5. Prepare questions for the interviewer

**Story Distribution Recommendation:**

- 2-3 conflict stories (different types: technical disagreement, stakeholder pushback, cross-team conflict)
- 2-3 ownership/initiative stories
- 1-2 growth/learning stories
- 1-2 communication stories
- 1-2 ambiguity/problem-solving stories

Remember: One well-crafted story can often answer multiple questions. Focus on quality over quantity and practice telling them using the three-act structure with proper time allocation (10-60-30 rule).
