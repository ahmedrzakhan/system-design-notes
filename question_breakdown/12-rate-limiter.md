# Distributed Rate Limiter System Design

## 🎯 Problem Overview

A rate limiter controls how many requests a client can make within a specific timeframe. It prevents abuse, protects servers from being overwhelmed, and ensures fair usage across all users.

## 📋 Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Identify clients** by user ID, IP address, or API key
2. **Limit HTTP requests** based on configurable rules (e.g., 100 requests/minute)
3. **Reject excess requests** with HTTP 429 and helpful headers (X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset)

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Low latency**: < 10ms per request check
2. **High availability** > Strong consistency (eventual consistency is acceptable)
3. **Scale**: Handle 1M requests/second across 100M daily active users

## 🏗️ High-Level Architecture

### Rate Limiter Placement Options

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "❌ Bad: In-Process"
        C1[Client] --> G1[Gateway]
        G1 --> MS1[Microservice 1<br/>with RL]
        G1 --> MS2[Microservice 2<br/>with RL]
        G1 --> MS3[Microservice 3<br/>with RL]
    end
```

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "✅ Good: Dedicated Service"
        C2[Client] --> G2[Gateway]
        G2 --> RL[Global Rate Limiter]
        RL --> MS4[Microservice 1]
        RL --> MS5[Microservice 2]
        RL --> MS6[Microservice 3]
    end
```

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "✅✅ Best: API Gateway Integration"
        C3[Client] --> GW[API Gateway<br/>with Rate Limiter]
        GW --> MS7[Microservice 1]
        GW --> MS8[Microservice 2]
        GW --> MS9[Microservice 3]
    end
```

**Choice: API Gateway** - Best because it:

- Blocks bad requests at the edge
- Reduces load on backend services
- Centralized control and monitoring
- No additional network hops for each request

### Client Identification Strategy

- **User ID**: For authenticated users (from JWT tokens)
- **IP Address**: For anonymous users (from X-Forwarded-For header)
- **API Key**: For developer APIs (from X-API-Key header)
- **Layered approach**: Apply multiple rules, enforce most restrictive

## 🔄 Rate Limiting Algorithms

### 1. Fixed Window Counter

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Window 1: 00:00-00:59"
        R1[100 requests allowed]
    end
    subgraph "Window 2: 01:00-01:59"
        R2[100 requests allowed]
    end
```

- **Problem**: Boundary effect - user can make 200 requests in 2 seconds at window boundary

### 2. Sliding Window Log

- Maintains timestamp log of all requests
- Perfect accuracy but high memory usage
- O(n) space complexity where n = requests per window

### 3. Sliding Window Counter

- Hybrid approach using weighted average of current and previous windows
- Good accuracy with minimal memory (2 counters per client)

### 4. Token Bucket ✅ (Recommended)

```mermaid
graph TB
    B[Token Bucket<br/>Capacity: 100]
    B --> |Refill Rate: 10/min| B
    R[Request] --> |Consumes 1 token| B
    B --> |Tokens > 0| A[Allow]
    B --> |Tokens = 0| D[Deny/429]
```

**Why Token Bucket?**

- Handles burst traffic naturally
- Simple implementation
- Memory efficient (tokens + last_refill_time)
- Used by companies like Stripe

## 💾 State Management with Redis

### Basic Implementation

```python
# Pseudocode for Token Bucket with Redis
def isRequestAllowed(client_id, rule_id):
    # Atomic operation using Lua script
    bucket_key = f"{client_id}:bucket"

    # Get current state
    tokens, last_refill = redis.HMGET(bucket_key, "tokens", "last_refill")

    # Calculate tokens to add
    time_passed = current_time - last_refill
    tokens_to_add = time_passed * refill_rate
    new_tokens = min(bucket_capacity, tokens + tokens_to_add)

    # Check if request allowed
    if new_tokens >= 1:
        # Update state atomically
        redis.MULTI()
        redis.HSET(bucket_key, "tokens", new_tokens - 1)
        redis.HSET(bucket_key, "last_refill", current_time)
        redis.EXPIRE(bucket_key, 3600)  # Auto-cleanup after 1 hour
        redis.EXEC()
        return True

    return False
```

### Race Condition Solution

Use **Lua scripting** for atomic read-modify-write operations to prevent race conditions between multiple gateways.

## 📈 Scaling Strategy

### Horizontal Scaling with Redis Sharding

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "API Gateways"
        GW1[Gateway 1]
        GW2[Gateway 2]
        GW3[Gateway 3]
    end

    subgraph "Redis Cluster (Sharded)"
        R1[Redis Shard 1<br/>Users A-H]
        R2[Redis Shard 2<br/>Users I-P]
        R3[Redis Shard 3<br/>Users Q-Z]
    end

    GW1 & GW2 & GW3 --> |Consistent Hashing| R1 & R2 & R3

    R1 & R2 & R3 --> S[Backend Services]
```

**Key Points:**

- Use **consistent hashing** to distribute users across shards
- Each shard handles ~100k ops/second
- 10 shards = 1M requests/second capability
- Consider Redis Cluster for automatic sharding

## 🔥 Handling Common Challenges

### 1. High Availability

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Redis HA Setup"
        M1[Redis Master 1] --> R1[Replica 1]
        M2[Redis Master 2] --> R2[Replica 2]
        M3[Redis Master 3] --> R3[Replica 3]
    end
```

**Failure Modes:**

- **Fail-Closed** ✅ (Recommended for critical systems): Reject all requests when Redis unavailable
- **Fail-Open**: Allow all requests when Redis unavailable (risky during attacks)

### 2. Latency Optimization

- **Connection pooling**: Reuse TCP connections
- **Geographic distribution**: Deploy Redis close to users
- **Local caching**: Cache recent decisions (with TTL)
- **Pipelining**: Batch Redis operations

### 3. Hot Keys (Viral/Attack Scenarios)

**For Legitimate High-Volume:**

- Client-side rate limiting (SDK level)
- Request batching
- Premium tiers with dedicated infrastructure

**For Abusive Traffic:**

- Auto-blocking after repeated violations
- IP blocklisting
- DDoS protection (Cloudflare/AWS Shield)

### 4. Dynamic Configuration

```mermaid
graph LR
    CM[Config Manager<br/>ZooKeeper/etcd] --> |Push updates| GW1[Gateway 1]
    CM --> |Push updates| GW2[Gateway 2]
    CM --> |Push updates| GW3[Gateway 3]
```

**Options:**

- **Poll-based**: Gateways poll config every 30s (simple, slight delay)
- **Push-based**: ZooKeeper/etcd push updates immediately (complex, real-time)

## 📊 Response Format

### HTTP 429 Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
Retry-After: 60
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "message": "You have exceeded the rate limit of 100 requests per minute"
}
```
