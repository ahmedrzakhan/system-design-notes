# Ticketmaster System Design - Interview Guide

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Design an online platform like Ticketmaster that allows users to purchase tickets for concerts, sports events, theater, and other live entertainment.

## 📋 Requirements Gathering

### Functional Requirements (Top 3)
1. **Users should be able to view events** 
   - Event details, venue info, seat map with availability
2. **Users should be able to search for events**
   - By keywords, location, date, artist/team, event type
3. **Users should be able to book tickets to events**
   - Reserve seats, make payments, prevent double booking

### Below the Line (Out of Scope)
- Users viewing their booked events
- Admin flows (adding/editing events)
- Dynamic pricing for popular events

### Non-Functional Requirements (Top 4)
1. **Prioritize availability for search/viewing, consistency for booking** (no double booking)
2. **Handle high throughput** (10M users, popular events)
3. **Low latency search** (< 500ms)
4. **Read-heavy system** (100:1 read/write ratio)

### Below the Line (Out of Scope)
- GDPR compliance
- Fault tolerance
- Secure transactions
- CI/CD pipelines
- Regular backups

## 🏗️ Core Entities

```
📊 Core Entities:
• Event: id, venueId, performerId, name, description, date, tickets[]
• User: id, name, email, etc.
• Performer: id, name, description, links
• Venue: id, location, capacity, seatMap
• Ticket: id, eventId, seat, price, status (available/reserved/booked), userId
• Booking: id, userId, ticketIds[], totalPrice, status (in-progress/confirmed)
```

## 🔌 API Design

### Core APIs
```http
# View Event
GET /events/:eventId 
→ Event & Venue & Performer & Ticket[]

# Search Events  
GET /events/search?keyword={keyword}&start={start_date}&end={end_date}&pageSize={page_size}&page={page_number}
→ Event[]

# Book Tickets (Initial)
POST /bookings/:eventId 
→ bookingId
{
  "ticketIds": string[], 
  "paymentDetails": {...}
}

# Enhanced Booking APIs (Later)
POST /bookings/reserve → bookingId
POST /bookings/confirm → confirmation
```

## 🔧 Key Deep Dives

### 1. Preventing Double Booking

#### ❌ Bad Solution: Long-running Database Locks
- Uses `SELECT FOR UPDATE` with extended transactions
- Problems: Resource strain, deadlocks, poor scalability

#### ✅ Good Solution: Status Field with Expiration
```sql
-- Ticket states: available, reserved, booked
-- Add expiration_time field
-- Use cron job to clean expired reservations
```

#### 🚀 Great Solution: Distributed Lock with TTL
```redis
# Redis lock with automatic expiration
SET ticket:123 user:456 EX 600  # 10 minutes TTL
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatic cleanup via TTL
- High performance
- Handles failures gracefully
- No database strain

### 2. Scaling Read Operations

#### Caching Strategy
```mermaid
graph LR
    Client --> CDN[CDN<br/>Static Assets]
    Client --> Cache[Redis Cache<br/>Event Details]
    Cache --> DB[PostgreSQL<br/>Source of Truth]
    
    Cache --> |TTL Policy| EventData[Event Data<br/>Long TTL]
    Cache --> |Real-time| TicketStatus[Ticket Status<br/>Short TTL]
```

**Cache Layers:**
- **CDN**: Static content (images, CSS, JS)
- **Redis**: Event details, venue info (long TTL)
- **Application**: Computed seat maps

#### Horizontal Scaling
- Load balancers with round-robin/least connections
- Stateless services for easy scaling
- Database read replicas

### 3. Search Optimization

#### ❌ Basic SQL Search (Slow)
```sql
-- Full table scan - very slow
SELECT * FROM Events 
WHERE name LIKE '%Taylor%' 
   OR description LIKE '%Taylor%'
```

#### ✅ Better: Database Indexes
- B-tree indexes on frequently searched columns
- Full-text search extensions (PostgreSQL FTS)

#### 🚀 Best: Elasticsearch
```mermaid
graph TB
    SearchService --> ES[Elasticsearch Cluster]
    ES --> Inverted[Inverted Indexes]
    ES --> Fuzzy[Fuzzy Search]
    ES --> Relevance[Relevance Scoring]
    
    PostgreSQL --> CDC[Change Data Capture]
    CDC --> ES
```

**Features:**
- Inverted indexes for fast text search
- Fuzzy matching for typos
- Real-time sync via CDC
- Distributed and scalable

### 4. Handling Popular Events

#### 🎯 Real-time Updates Problem
Users see stale seat maps and click unavailable seats.

#### ✅ Good Solution: Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Push real-time seat updates to clients
- Works for moderate traffic

#### 🚀 Great Solution: Virtual Waiting Queue
```mermaid
graph TB
    User --> Queue[Virtual Queue<br/>WebSocket Connection]
    Queue --> Position[Queue Position<br/>Estimated Wait Time]
    Queue --> Dequeue[Periodic Dequeue<br/>Allow Booking Access]
    Dequeue --> BookingPage[Booking Interface]
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents system overload
- Better user experience
- Manages expectations with wait times
- Admin-controlled for high-demand events

### 5. Search Performance Optimization

#### Query Result Caching
```redis
# Cache structure
search:keyword=taylor&date=2024-01-01:results
search:location=london&type=concert:results
```

#### Edge Caching with CDN
- Geographic distribution
- Cache popular search results
- Reduces latency globally

    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Bookings Table
CREATE TABLE bookings (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
    total_price DECIMAL(10,2),
    status VARCHAR(20) CHECK (status IN ('in-progress', 'confirmed', 'cancelled')),
    stripe_payment_id VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    confirmed_at TIMESTAMP

## 🔍 Common Interview Questions & Answers

### Q: "What happens if Redis goes down?"
**A**: We'd have a 10-minute window where multiple users could reach payment for the same ticket. However, our database still ensures consistency through atomic transactions. Users get errors instead of double bookings - poor experience but maintains data integrity.

### Q: "How do you keep event cache synchronized?"
**A**: We don't cache ticket availability with event details. Event details (rarely changing) are cached with long TTL. Ticket availability is checked separately by querying the ticket table and cross-referencing with Redis locks.

### Q: "Why not use optimistic concurrency control?"
**A**: Works for low concurrency, but with millions of users competing for limited seats, most requests would fail with version conflicts, creating a poor user experience.

## 💡 Pro Tips for Interview Success
